Find out how Drools Fusion delivers complex event processing (CEP) capabilities to build active decision management applications. Learn more about BPMN2 and the standards-based BPM implementation in DroolsFlow. Presenter: Mark Proctor received his B.S. Eng. in Engineer Science and Technology and then his M.S. in Business and Information Systems; both from Brunel University, West London. His M.S. thesis was in the field of Genetic Algorithms; which is where he first got his interest for anything AI related. Mark became involved in the Drools expert system project at an early stage and soon became its project lead. Mark then joined JBoss (later acquired by RedHat) as an employee when the Drools project was federated into the JBoss JEMS stack.

Our live demonstration includes multiple servers, workstations and mobile devices. We setup a network using equipment you can purchase at your local electronics store and built a mini-datacenter for the stage. We required WIFI connectivity, internet access, a live Twitter stream, audience participation and even managed to avoid system failure while \"pulling the plug\" on one of our servers. In short, we pulled off something miraculous, a maximum risk, live demonstration and lived to tell (actually tweet) about it! Key Proof points: - lightweight & embeddable - you will want to cram as many applications on the smallest possible machines - adaptable & available - you will need it to be highly elastic but also fault-tolerant - real-time - we live in a world where decisions must be made instantly Key technologies: - HTML5 - for real-time visualization of an elastic data grid (Infinispan) - Mobile web - all UIs were mobile web ready - demonstrated on iOS and Android devices - JSF2 and RichFaces4 - with real-time server-side push to the browser - Infinispan - All data held in the data grid - no database, NoSQL - Hibernate OGM (Object Grid Mapper) - even though there is no database, we can still access the data grid as if it were a relational database, using JPA and Hibernate - Drools - the data stream analyzer, allows us to sort the important and actionable information from the raw stream of data. - CDI - Contexts and Dependency Injection - the programming model of EE6 and JBoss - GWT and Errai - extending the CDI event model from the server out to the client More details at: http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote"],

        "sys_description": ["Presenter: Marius Bogoevici Description: Getting the best experience while developing Spring applications owes a lot to running them on a state-of-the-art application server. In this session, we will show you how JBoss AS7 with its new architecture and a new set of features provides an ideal environment for developing and deploying Spring applications. There are multiple ways in which a Spring developer can benefit from the overall goodness that is JBoss AS7. On one hand, you can use it as a generic Java EE 6 application server and stay up-to-date with the latest enterprise Java specification, while continuing to use your favorite development model. However, for advanced users, taking advantage of features which are unique to JBoss AS is what can provide a competitive edge, and in this webinar we will cover both angles. This webinar is addressing developers and architects that use Spring in their applications, both new to JBoss AS or seasoned users of a previous version of it. For new users, it will demonstrate how to run Spring applications in JBoss AS7. and for existing users it will distill the new features of JBoss AS7 from a Spring user perspective, including how Snowdrop, the JBoss extension for Spring is addressing their needs. Since staying in touch with technical advances is critical for the success of an enterprise application, a question often asked is how can Spring developers blend with CDI, the Java EE 6 native dependency injection model, to create applications which are both future-proof, but also friendly to existing code, which is another important aspect of adopting JBoss AS7 as the runtime of choice. In response to that, the webinar will cover the Spring/CDI integration which currently exists as part of the Seam project. Presenter Bio: Marius Bogoevici is a Senior Software Engineer with Red Hat, leading the JBoss AS/Spring integration efforts. He is currently the lead for Snowdrop, a utility package that contains JBoss-specific extensions to the Spring Framework. He makes regular contributions to Weld, the JSR-299 Reference Implementation. Marius has an extensive experience of more than 14 years developing and architecting software systems. Prior to joining Red Hat, he was a Spring consultant with SpringSource. He is a contributor to the Spring Integration enterprise integration framework and co-author of \"Spring Integration in Action\"."],

And while JBoss is best known for being a Java EE container, in this session, we will focus on the OSGi capabilities of the new JBoss AS7. Starting with background information on OSGi in general, Thomas Diesler introduces the main objectives of this technology and explains the unique JBoss OSGi vision. Combining the best of two worlds we show how modern Java EE applications on AS7 can use the OSGi component model and vice versa. Presenters: Thomas Diesler and David Bosschaert Thomas is the OSGi Project Lead at JBoss. As the Red Hat representative in the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group he is involved in the standardization effort of various OSGi technologies that are relevant to the enterprise space. David, principal software engineer at Red Hat, is a co-chair of the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group and spends the majority of his time on the JBoss OSGi framework and other open source projects. Before joining JBoss/Red Hat in 2010, David worked for IONA Technologies and Progress Software in Dublin, Ireland."],

That it proves your implementation, and that it documents for other maintainers its use.

Tests have been slow to write, slow to execute, and push back our deadlines. It doesn't have to be that way anymore. In this session, we'll explore techniques to skip the build and stay within the IDE, reduce boilerplate by harnessing an annotation-driven framework, and hook into some common embeddable EE containers from a plain JavaSE environment.

Don't worry, if you saw Burr Sutter's webinar on September 21st (http://vimeo.com/29403374), and have basic knowledge of JSF you'll be all set. With JSF 2 and RichFaces 4 you can still get the advantages of working with Java EE6 while working with the latest in client technology.

Server-side Java guys must become vastly more savvy with the various frameworks, tools and techniques needed to build mobile friendly, HTML5-based web applications. In this session, we will distill HTML5 into the most important aspects that impact the Java web developer community. The focus of this session will be on practical tips and techniques for how to best take advantage of HTML5 features in your Java-based applications. We will have demonstrations and code samples to illustrate how to leverage your current server-side Java coding skills by adding RIA-focused HTML 5 features that are available on today's mobile platforms. Presenter Bio: Burr Sutter is a currently a Java Champion, previously president of the Atlanta Java Users Group, founder of the DevNexus Conference and he works for JBoss by Red Hat. He also founded the Atlanta chapter of the International Association of Software Architects and has spent 20 years teaching technologies to other technologists. Previous speaking engagements include: JavaOne, Javapolis (now Devoxx), No Fluff Just Stuff, Jazoon, the TDC in Sao Paulo and various JUGs around the globe."],
